feats:

* 30-40% faster savefile loading
* Up to 5-7x faster savefile saving
* idkx (maybe 200-400%) game resource loading
* 5-10% faster string creation
* Mod can be safely uninstalled and your savefile will still load

Overall, game launches can be up to 2-2.5x faster, on my machine on average the speed goes up from ~3.85s to ~1.85s (38mb save, i5-13600k, no megahack, with globed asset preloading)
